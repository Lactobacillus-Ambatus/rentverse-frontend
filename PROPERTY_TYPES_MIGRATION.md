# Property Types API Migration - Complete ‚úÖ

## Summary
Successfully migrated from proxy approach to direct API calls for property types functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Client (`utils/propertyTypesApiClient.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Changed base URL from `https://curious-lively-monster.ngrok-free.app/api` to `https://rentverse-be.jokoyuliyanto.my.id/api`
- ‚úÖ Added authentication support with Bearer token from localStorage
- ‚úÖ Simplified logic to use direct API calls only (removed multiple attempt approach)
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling with specific status code messages

### 2. Updated Property Types Hook (`hooks/usePropertyTypes.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Removed proxy client import and dependency
- ‚úÖ Removed debug utility import
- ‚úÖ Simplified to use only direct API client
- ‚úÖ Updated fallback data to match API response format with correct icons
- ‚úÖ Improved error messages for auth-related issues (401, 403)

### 3. Updated Type Definitions (`types/property.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Added `icon?: string` field to `PropertyTypeDetail` interface to match API response

### 4. Fixed Property Upload API (`utils/propertyUploadApi.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Removed proxy client reference
- ‚úÖ Updated to use only direct API client

### 5. Removed Obsolete Files
- ‚úÖ Deleted `utils/propertyTypesApiClientProxy.ts`
- ‚úÖ Deleted `app/api/property-types-proxy/route.ts` (entire directory)
- ‚úÖ Deleted `utils/debugPropertyTypes.ts`
- ‚úÖ Deleted debug shell script `debug-property-types.sh`

## API Response Format
The new API returns property types with icons included:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Property types retrieved successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "39ce6ad7-2b47-480f-ac2b-a322e73486fd",
      "code": "APARTMENT",
      "name": "Apartment",
      "description": "High-rise residential unit in apartment building",
      "icon": "üè¢",
      "isActive": true,
      "createdAt": "2025-10-01T16:09:59.265Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-10-01T17:15:08.168Z"
    }
    // ... more property types
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "total": 7,
    "pages": 1
  }
}
```

## Authentication
The API client now automatically includes the auth token from localStorage:
- Token is retrieved from `localStorage.getItem('authToken')`
- Added as `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
- Falls back gracefully if no token is available

## Error Handling
Improved error messages for common scenarios:
- **401 Unauthorized**: "Authentication required - please log in"
- **403 Forbidden**: "Access denied - insufficient permissions"
- **404 Not Found**: "API endpoint not found - check backend configuration"
- **500 Server Error**: "Server error - please try again later"
- **Network Error**: "Network error - check your internet connection"

## Fallback Behavior
If the API fails for any reason, the application falls back to static property types data that matches the API format, ensuring the UI continues to work.

## Testing Verification
‚úÖ API endpoint tested successfully with curl command
‚úÖ All proxy references removed from codebase
‚úÖ No remaining import errors or missing dependencies
‚úÖ Error handling validated for different scenarios

## Next Steps
The property types functionality is now fully migrated and ready for use with the new backend API. The system will automatically handle authentication and gracefully degrade to fallback data if needed.
